# django-iot

This repository is based on the Django rest server and includes several ready-to-use micro-controller/micro-processor codes written with Arduino IDE. It serves as a backend for various IoT devices such as sensors, motors, relays, and others. The repository enables remote data posting from these devices and facilitates sophisticated computations.

## Current IoT Automations

1. Ultrasonic Sensor Project:
   - **Description:** This automation is designed to provide alerts and display protective measures remotely whenever someone approaches a certain protected object. It utilizes an ultrasonic sensor to detect the proximity of objects.
   - **Purpose:** Enhance security and safety measures by monitoring the surroundings and reacting to potential threats in real-time.

2. Smart Water-Tanks Filling System:
   - **Description:** This automation aims to automate the process of filling water tanks in homes or offices. It utilizes sensors and controllers to monitor the water level in the tanks and control the filling process automatically.
   - **Purpose:** Improve water and electricity efficiency by optimizing the filling process, preventing overflows, and minimizing wastage.

## Future Development

In the future, we plan to develop a mobile application that will provide users and clients with more flexibility and portability. The mobile app will enable remote control and monitoring of the IoT automations supported by this repository, allowing users to access and manage their devices from anywhere.

Stay tuned for updates as we continue to enhance the functionalities and expand the capabilities of the `django-iot` repository.

## Getting Started

To get started with the `django-iot` repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/django-iot.git

2. Install the required dependencies. Make sure you have Python and Django installed:

   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Set up the Django database:

   ```shell
   python manage.py migrate

4. Run the development server:

   ```shell
   python manage.py runserver

Now you can access the Django rest server and explore the available APIs.
